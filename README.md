# EcoTrack - Carbon Footprint Calculator for Blockchain Transactions

EcoTrack is a simple carbon footprint calculator designed to estimate the environmental impact of blockchain transactions, specifically for the Stacks network. With blockchain adoption growing, it’s important to understand the ecological footprint of on-chain activities. EcoTrack helps users calculate and track the carbon emissions generated from their blockchain interactions, offering insights into the environmental cost of decentralized technologies.

## Features

- **Transaction-based Carbon Footprint Calculation**: Estimates the carbon emissions based on the transaction size and type (e.g., simple transfers, smart contract executions, NFT minting).
- **Real-time Emission Tracking**: Retrieves real-time data from the Stacks blockchain to provide more accurate and up-to-date emission estimates.
- **Carbon Offset Suggestions**: Suggests ways to offset emissions, including donations to carbon offset projects or staking in eco-friendly blockchain initiatives.
- **Emission Comparison Tool**: Compares the carbon footprint of different transaction types (e.g., simple transfers vs. smart contract interactions).
- **Historical Footprint Tracker**: Tracks a user’s cumulative carbon footprint over time, showing trends and insights.
- **Blockchain Comparison**: Compare the environmental impact of transactions across different blockchains (Stacks vs. Ethereum, Bitcoin, etc.).
- **Emission Reduction Tips**: Provides practical tips on reducing blockchain-related emissions (e.g., eco-friendly validators, reducing transaction frequency).
- **Eco-friendly Blockchain Certification**: Offers certification for eco-friendly projects or transactions that focus on minimizing environmental impact.

## How It Works

1. **Input Transaction Data**: The user inputs details of the blockchain transaction (size, type of operation, contract interaction).
2. **Carbon Emission Calculation**: EcoTrack calculates the carbon footprint by analyzing transaction data and using factors like energy consumption per transaction and average emissions per kWh.
3. **Display Results**: The app displays the estimated carbon footprint (in CO2 emissions) for the user’s transaction.
4. **Suggestions and Tracking**: Provides suggestions on how to offset emissions and tracks the user’s historical environmental impact.
